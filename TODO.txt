TODO:

  Gustaf:
    - write API documentation of endpoint, returned JSON structure (or clear text, depending on content type header ) , etc (use swagger if you know it)
      - for now, {base_url} is good for a replacement
    - create the vertex API based on documentation
    - set up database as required (local first, when we work out hosting then we can do prod)
    
  Nathan:
    - research slack integration (python?)
    - write the slack integration
    - whip up the single word webpage
 
  Both:
    - hosting (AWS, University of Waterloo)
    - think up more related endpoints we can open up
      - a PUT endpoint that can gather words for us (how would they use it, should we add a front end webpage component
      for that, how to prevent abuse, etc)
      - other word groups
      - something else that uses the pp database table
